Description: Simplifying and facilitating the time consuming and error prone task of assembling complex data sets for non-linear mixed effects modeling. Users are able to select from different absorption processes such as zero- and first-order, or a combination of both. Furthermore, data sets containing data from one or more analytes, and/or one or more responses, and/or time dependent and/or independent covariates, and/or urine data can be simultaneously assembled.
